        Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
        This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically in structures called thylakoids.
        The main pigment involved in photosynthesis is chlorophyll, which absorbs light primarily in the blue and red wavelengths.
        
        The process can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.
        In the light-dependent reactions, light energy is captured and used to produce ATP and NADPH.
        The Calvin cycle uses these energy carriers to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.
        
        The overall equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy ‚Üí C6H12O6 + 6O2
        This process is crucial for life on Earth as it produces oxygen and forms the base of most food chains.
